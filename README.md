# Pyscape
**Wordscape on python**
## Description
  I recreated the mobile game, Wordscape, on python. Using a random English word from a list, the program creates a scrabble-like table of all the words that can be made up of the letters from the initial random word. Users are then prompted to guess the censored words on the board given the scrambled letters.
## Instructions
  You can use one of the list of words I have above, wordlist.txt contains 20042 words, while smallwordlist.txt contains <10000. I find smallwordlist to have too few words and limit creativity, but wordlist contains not commonly know words, and making it too hard. Feel free to make one yourself, if you find any problems. I also have a few dictionarys commented out; they require the following pip install:
  **For the english-words library containing 235970 words**
  '''
  pip install english-words
  '''
  **For the nltk.corpus library containing 236736 words**
  '''
  pip install nltk.corpus
  '''
## Inspiration
  This project was inspired by my mom, who is on level 2504 on Wordscape. I thought it would be a fun and technically challenging coding project. Iâ€™m currently working on making a more user-friendly display, instead of the terminal.
## Credits
  Shoutout to my wonderful mother that unintentionally gave me the idea. Also, credits to my gym partner, Declan, for helping me with a specific problem I was having with the print_board function.
